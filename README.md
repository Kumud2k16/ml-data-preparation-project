# ML Data Preparation Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of preparing a dataset for machine learning modeling. The focus is on data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature preparation using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

The final output is a clean, structured dataset suitable for training machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical business problem where organizations aim to identify customers who are likely to stop using their services.  
The goal of this project is to prepare a customer churn dataset for use in a machine learning classification model.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Customer Churn Dataset
- **Source:** IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Unit of Observation:** One row per customer

## Project Objectives
- Load and inspect raw data
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Handle missing values and data types
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Prepare a final dataset ready for machine learning
